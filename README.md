***

*SQANTI-SIM* is a simulator of controlled novelty and degradation of transcripts sequenced by long reads. It is a wrapper tool for RNA-Seq long-reads simulators such as [IsoSeqSim](https://github.com/yunhaowang/IsoSeqSim) and [NanoSim](https://github.com/bcgsc/NanoSim) (formerly Trans-NanoSim) to simulate transcripts based on the SQANTI3 structural categories ([publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5848618/) and [code repository](https://github.com/ConesaLab/SQANTI3)).

The aim of SQANTI-SIM is to simulate novel and degradated transcripts in a controlled way using as ground-truth real transcripts in the reference annotation that fit the description of the different SQANTI3 structural categories.
